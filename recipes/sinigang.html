    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Sinigang is a sour soup native to the Philippines. This recipe uses pork as the main ingredient. Other proteins and seafood can also be used. Beef, shrimp, fish are commonly used to cook sinigang. The chicken version, on the other hand, is called sinampalukang manok.</p>
        <p>One of the things that make sinampalukang manok different from sinigang is its use of ginger. It is sauteed along with garlic and onion and then boiled with the chicken and tamarind leaves/flower buds to create the soup base. It sounded unusual at first. Ginger is necessary as it gives the dish a distinct flavor and it makes it more comforting especially when you have the hot soup during cold weather or on a rainy day.</p>
